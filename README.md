## How to

This project uses Apache Ant, to run just type these commands from command line / terminal:

```bash
# clean build
$ ant clean

# compile/build
$ ant compile

# make executable jar
$ ant jar

```

Modify the <property> inside `build.xml` to suit your needs for the classification method, you can also modify the train/test/index folders location if you really need to, else just paste in your data inside the provided location.
